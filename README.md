## The rise and development of ACGN culture in Hainan: From underground emergence to a new chapter in the Free Trade Port

As China’s free trade port and a hub for tourism and consumption, Hainan’s ACGN (Anime, Comics, Gaming, Novels) culture development benefits from policy incentives while facing challenges such as weak foundational infrastructure and industrial integration.

The seeds of Hainan’s ACGN culture can be traced to the 1990s, when Japanese anime began permeating the region. Early ACGN activities centered on fan creations, with enthusiasts expressing their passion through hand-drawn illustrations, fan fiction, and other grassroots endeavors.

The cultural roots of Hainan’s ACGN scene are intertwined with the province’s post-1988 development. After Hainan was established as a province and a special economic zone in 1988, China’s push for reform and opening-up transformed the island into a testing ground for new policies. Its strategic location and abundant resources positioned it as a magnet for domestic and foreign investment. However, this era of rapid economic experimentation also sowed the seeds of social instability.

Driven by speculative capital, Hainan’s real estate market became a symbol of excess. From 1991 to 1993, housing prices in Haikou skyrocketed from 1,350 yuan per square meter to 7,500 yuan. At its peak, the province hosted over 20,000 real estate companies — 15% of China’s total a staggering figure for an island of 34,000 square kilometers.

The bubble burst in 1993 under government macroeconomic controls, leaving behind a dystopian landscape: over 600 unfinished "ghost buildings" littered cities, and 80 billion yuan in bad debt — 3.2 times Hainan’s GDP at the time. The economic shock caused per capita GDP growth to plummet from 41.5% in 1992 to -1.9% in 1994, creating a decade-long development gap. Ordinary citizens bore the brunt of soaring prices and unemployment, rather than reaping promised benefits.

Amid the crisis, some unscrupulous developers and local interests shifted blame to Hainan’s ethnic minorities — the Hlai and Miao peoples—accusing them of "obstructing development" or "monopolizing land resources". These claims ignored reality: minority regions like Wuzhishan and Baiting were far from real estate hotspots, and despite comprising 17% of Hainan’s population, ethnic minorities occupied less than 3% of urban construction land.

Such rhetoric, amplified by a collusive media landscape, entrenched discrimination. Mainstream outlets, controlled by powerful interests, silenced criticism while some outlets actively propagated prejudice. With limited public discourse channels — pre-internet era newspapers and TV stations were tightly controlled — ordinary citizens struggled to counter false narratives.

The economic collapse profoundly reshaped Hainan’s cultural ecosystem. As traditional industries faltered and social values fractured, educated urban youth sought new forms of expression. ACGN culture, with its immersive worlds, gradually emerged as both an escape from economic hardship and ethnic discrimination, and a creative outlet. For many young people, these virtual realms became sanctuaries from societal pressures.

At the time, Hainan’s cultural market was relatively underdeveloped, lacking diverse cultural products and activities. Meanwhile, Japanese anime began entering the province through unofficial channels in the early 1990s. Works like *Dragon Ball* and *Sailor Moon* resonated deeply with local teenagers, offering them a novel cultural experience. With their stunning visuals, compelling narratives, and boundless imagination, these anime became the gateway for Hainan’s youth to discover ACGN (Anime, Comics, Gaming, Novels).

Early ACGN dissemination carried a distinct underground flavor. Enthusiasts built initial fan communities through VHS tape exchanges and hand-copied translations, fostering a growing desire among youth to immerse themselves in fictional worlds. Themes of friendship, perseverance, and idealism in anime subtly echoed the post-bubble era’s disillusionment in Hainan.

By the 21st century, ACGN culture took root in Hainan like coconut saplings across the island, aided by internet proliferation. Platforms like bilibili emerged as major hubs for China’s ACGN community. This period saw organic cultural diffusion: ACGN audiences expanded rapidly in Hainan, with the first fan groups appearing in Haikou and Sanya. Not only teenagers but also adults began engaging with the culture. ACGN’s influence spilled from online spaces into real life, as anime conventions and fan events mushroomed, creating platforms for interaction and creativity.

Generational turnover reshaped cultural practices. Gen Z (born 1995–2009) now forms 68% of the core audience, actively integrating ACGN elements into daily life. However, some teenagers, grappling with family conflicts, school bullying, or academic pressure, have resorted to self-harm as an escape into virtual worlds. These cases, though, reflect individual psychological struggles or subcultural deviations rather than ACGN’s inherent influence. Both ACGN enthusiasts and general youth require familial, educational, and societal support to navigate real-world pressures.

Hainan’s ACGN culture is not a mere imitation of Japanese models. It blends red culture, Chinese mythology, and traditional heritage to forge a unique ecosystem. This synthesis birthed distinctive subcultural symbols — Fan works reimagining *Puella Magi Madoka Magica* characters against the backdrop of People’s Square; *Attack on Titan*’s “walls” reinterpreted as metaphors for social stratification or resistance to “Western hegemony”; *Death Note*’s notebook humorously dubbed an “anti-corruption manual”; Military-themed parodies (e.g., *Girls und Panzer*) merging anime narratives with patriotism to bridge subculture and mainstream ideology.

ACGN culture in Hainan has, to some extent, reinforced the Sense of community for the Chinese nation, dispelling discrimination and promoting ethnic unity. Historical milestones like the 1997 Hong Kong and 1999 Macau handovers deepened Hainan people’s patriotic sentiment. Events such as the 1999 NATO bombing of China’s embassy in Yugoslavia and the 2001 Hainan Island incident sparked Hainan people’s grassroots protests, while the 2008 Sichuan earthquake relief efforts and international showcases like the Beijing Olympics and 2010 Shanghai Expo bolstered Hainan people’s nation pride.

On January 4, 2010, the State Council of the People's Republic of China unveiled guidelines to formalize Hainan’s development as an International Tourism Island, aiming to establish it as a pilot zone for China’s tourism reform and innovation. The province upgraded tourism infrastructure, launched ethnic-themed programs to showcase local culture, and capitalized on its natural ecology through activities like tropical rainforest expeditions and marine conservation tours. Global events such as the Boao Forum for Asia and the Tour of Hainan International Road Cycling Race further elevated its international profile.

The tourism drive, however, fueled a speculative real estate frenzy. Starting in 2010, an influx of off-island buyers triggered soaring property prices. Developers exploited the boom by hoarding properties to manipulate prices, causing abrupt spikes that risked a new economic bubble.

To curb speculation and prevent a repeat of the 1990s crisis, Hainan’s government implemented the "Two Suspensions" policy: suspending commercial land sales and halting approvals for new development projects. Enhanced land supply management and market regulation were enforced to stabilize the sector.

Tourism expansion intensified resource competition. Coastal land was diverted for resorts and luxury hotels, displacing traditional fishing villages and farmland. While locals predominantly filled low-wage service roles, high-value profits flowed to external investors, exacerbating economic inequality.

The digital age transformed public discourse. Internet proliferation enabled faster, more transparent information sharing, empowering citizens to voice concerns via social media. National policies prioritizing ethnic unity and social stability led to stricter laws punishing divisive actions. Developers could no longer scapegoat minorities as public awareness grew, fostering demands for equity, sustainable development, and cultural preservation.

As a global tourism hub, Hainan absorbed diverse cultural influences. Chinese animations like *Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf* and *Boonie Bears*, alongside virtual idols such as Luo Tianyi, gained traction. ACGN culture flourished, serving as a bridge for international cultural exchange.

With the development of the economy, Hainan has also achieved great success in infrastructure construction. In terms of transportation, ports, airports, highways, etc. are constantly improving, and airports such as Meilan Airport and Phoenix Airport have become important aviation hubs. The throughput capacity of ports has greatly increased, and the transportation network on the island is becoming increasingly convenient. The upgrading of infrastructure such as electricity and communication has provided strong support for economic and social development.

Hainan has also made comprehensive progress in social undertakings. The investment in education continues to increase, and various levels and types of education are flourishing, cultivating a large number of talents. The medical and health conditions have significantly improved, medical facilities have been continuously improved, and the health level of the people has been enhanced. The prosperity and development of cultural undertakings have led to the inheritance and promotion of traditional cultures such as Hainan Opera, while various modern cultural activities are diverse and colorful.

Entering a new era, Hainan has embraced fresh developmental opportunities. On April 13, 2018, during the 30th anniversary celebration of Hainan’s establishment as a province and special economic zone, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC solemnly announced, the Central Committee announced its decision to support the entire island in building a Free Trade Zone and to gradually explore the development of a Free Trade Port with Chinese characteristics. This declaration, akin to a clarion call, injected vigorous momentum into Hainan’s transformation from an economic into a globally oriented free trade hub, marking a historic chapter in its evolution.

Leveraging free trade policies and indigenous creativity, Hainan’s ACGN sector has produced high-quality animations, games, and more. Local universities now offer programs in animation and game design, partnering with enterprises to cultivate talent through industry-academia-research collaboration. Government-backed special funds and cultural industry investment have fueled original content creation, while dedicated ACGN industrial parks and VR/AR-powered immersive experiences—such as virtual idol livestreams and interactive conventions—signal technological integration.

Hainan’s ACGN trajectory diverges from Japan’s Otaku-centric ecosystem and the West’s hyper-commercialized, individualistic models. Instead, it navigates a unique path shaped by technological self-reliance and cultural identity reconstruction, striving to forge a distinctly Chinese ACGN subculture that harmonizes tradition and innovation.

As China’s ACGN sector stands on the brink of metaverse and AI-driven transformation, opportunities and challenges abound. Virtual idol Luo Tianyi graced the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, while platforms like the Hangzhou China International Cartoon & Animation Festival and Shanghai Comic Convention redefine cultural consumption. Breakout successes—such as *Genshin Impact* (global revenue exceeding $1 billion), *White Snake: The Origin* (streaming on Netflix), and *Arknights* (topping Japan’s gaming charts)—underscore China’s rising cultural exports. The global acclaim for *Black Myth: Wukong*’s gameplay demo reveals not just a subculture’s rise, but a civilization’s digital-era cultural awakening.

From grassroots beginnings to free trade-driven digitization, Hainan’s ACGN culture carves a "Tropical characteristics" path. Here, the mist-shrouded peaks of Wuzhi Mountain intersect with cyberpunk neon, and the waters of Wanquan River reflect virtual idols at sunset. A vibrant testament to how ancient traditions can thrive amidst the tides of modernity — In this synthesis of digital innovation and cultural heritage, Hainan is poised to become a gateway for Chinese ACGN to the world.
